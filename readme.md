### Introduction 
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. A user plays against ai. The catch is that it’s unbeatable. If you somehow manage to win let me know, provide screenshot and I’ll send you a beer. 

### How does it work?

You have to enter both yours and CPU’s sign and hit play. From now on you simply click on a field you want to place your sign. When there’s a winner game field is being blocked and game needs to be restarded by clicking options→ restart the game.
